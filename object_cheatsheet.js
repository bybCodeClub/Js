// Modifying object in Javascript 

// To access an object property there are two ways .notation  and [bracket notation]

    Handsome: true,
    rich: "very true",
    smrt: " Well 2 out of 3 isn't bad",
    age:   25
} ;  

//  now to access some of the properties within this object you can use .notation
 
console.log(This_Person_object.Handsome)   // use the object name follow by a .   
console.log(This_Person_object.rich) 


// this is how you can add elements to an object 
This_Person_object.your_Sex = "yes Please"     
console.log(This_Person_object.your_Sex)

This_Person_object.name = "Mike"


// To delete a property from an object 

delete This_Person_object.smrt

console.log(This_Person_object.smrt)   // you should get undifined , as it been deleted.
